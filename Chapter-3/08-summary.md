Chapter 3 Summary

- Ordinary elliptic curves use $y^2 = x^3 + a_4x + a_6$ over a prime field.
- The point at infinity acts as the identity and is represented as $(0, 0)$.
- Point addition uses a unified slope formula to reduce side-channel leakage.
- Point multiplication uses double-and-add with repeated point addition.
- Embedding data increments $x$ until $f(x)$ is a quadratic residue.
