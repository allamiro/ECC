Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH)

In ECDH, each user has a private key (an integer) and a public key (a curve point).
Public keys are exchanged openly. Each side multiplies the other side's public key
by their own private key, and both sides obtain the same point on the curve.

Let:
- Curve $E$ and base point $G$ be public
- Alice private key $k_A$, public key $A = k_A G$
- Bob private key $k_B$, public key $B = k_B G$

Shared secret:
$$
S = k_A B = k_B A = k_A k_B G
$$

The shared secret for symmetric encryption is usually derived from the $x$ coordinate
of $S$, or from a hash of that coordinate.

Exercise 4.1
Can three parties compute a single shared secret using only pairwise public keys?
