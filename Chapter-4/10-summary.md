Chapter 4 Summary

- ECDH creates a shared secret by multiplying the other party’s public key by
  your private key.
- A hash-to-field routine converts a pass phrase into a private key without storage.
- MQV adds ephemeral keys for forward secrecy and combines static + ephemeral data.
- The associate value function uses half of an x coordinate plus a forced high bit.
- Test curves and harness code verify that both sides compute identical keyshares.
