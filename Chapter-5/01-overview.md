Chapter 5 Overview

This chapter covers two prime-field elliptic curve signature schemes:
- Schnorr signatures
- NIST ECDSA

Signatures use a private key to sign a document hash. The public key verifies the
signature by recomputing a point and checking consistency.

How to use this chapter
- Each section contains a short explanation, then Python and MATLAB listings.
- Each listing includes a “What it does” block and a small run example.
